# Robotics Major Project Presentation


## Part 1: Project Rational

Robotics exists as a midground between engineering and programming, so it is fitting that my major project reflects this balance 
perfectly. The basic principle of my project was to identify different RFID tags, sort them into two groups and then change the 
state of a physical lock according to the circumstance. To do this I needed to first learn how RFID chips interacted with an RFID receiver
and deduce the best method for locking mechanisms. After reviewing a few different designs online I settled on a Hall Sensor and solenoid 
lock arrangement that made the lock effective every time by ensuring the door was positioned correctly. The coding will use multiple states
to best ensure that the project works smoothly. The state-based programming will be complicated since I will need to account for multiple 
different devices interacting independently of each other. The construction portion of the project should pose little challenge, but the 
wiring and electronics will require time to complete properly. All the above factors should make my Major Project a task worthy of 5 weeks 
of work.
