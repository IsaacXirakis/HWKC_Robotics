# Robotics Major Project Presentation


## Part 1: Project Rational

Robotics exists as a midground between engineering and programming, so it is fitting that my major project reflects this balance 
perfectly. The basic principle of my project was to identify different RFID tags, sort them into two groups and then change the 
state of a physical lock according to the circumstance. To do this I needed to first learn how RFID chips interacted with an RFID receiver
and deduce the best method for locking mechanisms. After reviewing a few different designs online I settled on a Hall Sensor and solenoid 
lock arrangement that made the lock effective every time by ensuring the door was positioned correctly. The coding will use multiple states
to best ensure that the project works smoothly. The state-based programming will be complicated since I will need to account for multiple 
different devices interacting independently of each other. The construction portion of the project should pose little challenge, but the 
wiring and electronics will require time to complete properly. All the above factors should make my Major Project a task worthy of 5 weeks 
of work.

## Part 2: Design Documentation

The major project I embarked on, while quite code-intensive, did not require complex design choices. Because of this, the initial design has 
been accepted as the final version going into development. Through the research of other commercially available RFID cat doors, I created
a diagram of the project that will be the final version going into development. The diagram can be found both on the PowerPoint and in 
the links below. The code for the experiment presents a learning experience for me as it uses multiple devices instead of simply a lego
shield, but that coding itself is almost entirely state-based, a method I have experience in with previous projects. Code examples can 
be found in the inspirational projects, but these will be only used for guidance and not as a stand-in for my own work. 

## Part 3: Upcoming Workload and Timeline

The major project was designed to be completed in 5 weeks and I believe that my project can deliver with that by using the timeline I have 
set out. This timeline is reviewed in detail with the PowerPoint presentation. It is broken down into 3 major milestones: wiring, coding 
and construction. The timeline I have given allows for flexibility, meaning that should there be a delay the rest of the timeline should 
not be greatly affected.
